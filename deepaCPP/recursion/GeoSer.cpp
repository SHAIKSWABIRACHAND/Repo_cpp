/*Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series with a given 
first term a and common ratio r

sample output:
Enter the first term (a): 2                                                                                             
Enter the common ratio (r): 3                                                                                           
Enter the number of terms (n): 4                                                                                        
The sum of the first 4 terms of the geometric series is: 80
