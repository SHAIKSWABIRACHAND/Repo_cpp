/*Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series with a given 
first term a and common difference d.

sample output:
Enter the first term (a): 1                                                                                             
Enter the common difference (d): 1                                                                                      
Enter the number of terms (n): 5                                                                                        
Sum of the first 5 terms of the arithmetic series is: 15
